## Prerequisites & Installation

## Prerequisites 
Before you study AngularJS, you should have a basic understanding of:

- *[HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp)*
- *[CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp)*
- *[JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp)*

Assuming you have a basic [Angular](https://angular.io/start) knowledge lets go ahead, else please have a quick look at a crash course and come back here

## Installation
Assuming you already have a good IDE (am using VS Code here)
You will need Node.js & NPM, download [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) based on your OS
Once installed you can confirm by opening a terminal and typing below cmd
```
node -v
```
```
npm -v
```
